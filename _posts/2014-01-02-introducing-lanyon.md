---

I got interested in the data science field after reading the article on [HBR - The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century) but wasnt able to get a right direction on how to get started on my data science journey.

After a lot of research on the web and trying out various things, I've the following recommendations for the people who have basic programming knowledge on how to get started -
